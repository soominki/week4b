      <h1>Quora Redesign</h1>

      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Quora (quora.com) is a user-generated social media platform where
        members can answer, edit, and ask questions to a community. As a team
        of three, we were challenged to evaluate and analyze the online community
        on Quora and then come up with new features or redesign existing features
        on the platform. Specifically, we chose to analyze Quora through the
        lens of users commitment and user contribution and how we could boost
        both facets.
      </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        To analyze the platform, we came up with two research methods. For the
        first method, we went in as users ourselves and interacted with the
        community to first hand see how specific features of Quora encouraged
        contribution and commitment. We examined everything from the home feed,
        answer feed, profile and user interactions and then compared the
        implementation of these features to design claims from Chapters 2 and 3
        of "Building Sucessful Online Communities" by Robert E. Kraut and Paul
        Resnick.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the second method, we asked users and aggregated data from about
        40 different existing Quora posts to analyze users’ views of commitment
        and contribution. This method was uniquely possible due to the nature of
        Quora being a question and answer platform and having so much information
        out in the open.
      </p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>
        Through our research we found several ways that Quora's design features
        successfully motivate user commitment and contribution. However, we also
        found several avenues for improvement and platform features that currently
        discourage users from using the site and chose to focus on three main
        problems to redesign.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>OLD QUESTIONS WITH NO ANSWERS NEVER GET ANY ANSWERS</li>
        <li>
          The feed of Quora tends to focus on trying to get new questions
          answered and has questions quickly disappear when they get no
          attention. The questions that don’t get answers immediately almost
          never get answered in the future. This is can make it especially
          hard for new users to stay committed to Quora if they contribute
          questions but fail to get answers.
        </li>
        <li>THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT VIEWS ON HOW QUORA SHOULD BE USED</li>
        <li>
          There were also two distinctly different social norms that divided the
          way that users interact with the platform. One set of users viewed
          Quora as a space for free discussion and discourse to develop ideas.
          This would look like asking ambiguous questions about people’s
          thoughts towards certain topics or giving opinions about various
          subjects. Meanwhile, the other set of users viewed Quora as a rigid
          space for clear questions and knowledgeable answers. These opposing
          viewpoints on how to use Quora make it hard for people to grasp how
          to use Quora and discourage especially new users from participation.
        </li>
        <li>THE QUORA ALGORITHM CAN COME OFF AS CREEPY</li>
        <li>
          The personalization algorithm of Quora can sometimes come off as too
          personalized and creep users away from using the platform. The
          platform for some reason tends to know more information about the user
          than the user inputs. It also appears that Quora automatically adds
          topics to users’ feed without consent, which further detracts users.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, there are several barriers to users asking questions or
        answering questions and addressing these would help solve the problem
        of low contribution and commitment. To fix some of these problems, we
        created a few new design features that could be incorporated into the
        Quora platform.
      </p>
      <h3>ReAsk</h3>
      <p>
        For starters, we would like to create a newly-designed “ReAsk” feature
        where unanswered questions have another chance to be answered on the
        platform. Since one of the problems on Quora was the extremely large
        amount of questions that go unanswered, having a “ReAsk” option would
        help these questions come back into the main feed so that they could be
        answered. Users who might have missed these questions before now have an
        opportunity to see them, and the user putting out the original question
        would have a higher chance of getting a question answered, thus increasing
        their desire to contribute to the platform. Some questions might be
        insignificant or contribute little or nothing to the site, so we would
        intentionally set a limit on how many times a question can be re-asked
        before it gets covered up again by the rest of the feed.
      </p>
      <h3>New Separation of Feed</h3>
      <p>
        Since we also took notice of the division between users, (those who
        answer and ask straightforward questions with specific answers, and
        those who like to discuss opinions and experiences) we decided we could
        further bring more users into the community by catering the platform to
        whichever category each user falls under. We would have a “Quora Answer”
        mode and “Quora Discussion” mode along with a combined default mode where
        the user is able to see both modes if they choose to. First, when a user
        asks a question they would be able to specify if they wish their
        answers to be more straightforward or discussion-based. For example,
        if a user asked the question “What do you like best about the food in
        Singapore?” they would most likely select this question to be under
        “Quora Discussion” so that the users only interested in discussion
        (or users interested in both modes) would see this question. This helps
        users who prefer one type to have a more concise feed with content
        they want to contribute to, and users asking these questions also
        would have a higher rate of visibility since a smaller audience
        (who are more likely to answer these types of questions) would be
        viewing his or her question.
      </p>
      <h3>More Controlled Feed</h3>
      <p>
        To make users feel more comfortable with the site and stay engaged with
        the platform we proposed a more controlled feed. Before Quora
        automatically adds a new topic, we would design a section at the top of
        a user’s feed, say every 10 page loads, with recommended topics Quora
        believes would be relatable and interesting to that user. Quora would
        have the option to add these topics to the home feed, displaying maybe
        only 3 or 4 topics at a time. There would also be a “explore other
        recommended topics” option so that if the user is curious as to what
        other topics are out there, they are able to further interact with these
        other topics they might not have been exposed to before. This way we can
        cater to the users who want to deal exclusively with their topics of
        interest as well as the more curious, open-minded users.
