      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Had to create the branding and interface design for a client's personal
        food diary mobile app called FODMAPPA for people trying to manage IBS
        symptoms with a FODMAP diet. Features include a food diary, grocery lists,
        food information look up, food coupons, and more.

      <h2>Brand Identity</h2>
      <p>
        First looked at the types of designs that the client liked and then
        brainstormed and sketched different ways to convey the brand. After
        discussing the design options that were ideated, selected and developed
        a logo digitally in Adobe Illustrator. Then created a style guide for
        the brand.

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        Analyzed the UI design of several competing food diary apps on the IOS
        app store such as Noom, Bowelle, Oshi, Cara, and Suggestic. Mainly
        focused and critiqued Suggestic's design to form direction for the
        design direction of FODMAPPA. Then sketched wireframes by hand based
        off of the design direction.

      <h2>App Design</h2>
      <p>
        After receiving feedback on the wireframes, created high fidelity mockups
        in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. App contains design elements such as
        as intake trackers, FODMPA level indicators, and buttons. Also utilized
        Adobe XD to prototype a couple of functions and create a sample mobile
        walkthrough
